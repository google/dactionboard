  "description": "This folder contains source code for Cloud Function `create-vm`. The function's purpose is to create a VM in Compute Engine as a host for a Docker container with an image that is fetched from Container Registry.  The VM uses `workload` image from project's registry with `latest` tag.   See `index.js` for details. On deployment to a new project variables' values in `index.js` should be adjusted, see below.   The configuration for a VM being created is in `vmConfig` variable. The JSON config was got from UI wizard \"creating a new VM\" and then changed: * removed disk configuration because it contains hard-coded image url, instead root key was added `\"os\": \"cos\"` (note: cos stands for Container OS, a special OS for hosting Docker containers in GCP)",
